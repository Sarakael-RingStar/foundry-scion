  "description": "Second Edition Scion is a contemporary game of modern myth and epic heroism powered by the Storypath system.  \nScion is a game about Gods and humanity, and everything in between. \nScion: Origin details the Scions when they’re still (mostly) human, before the Visitation that introduces them to the divine World — they’re exceptional humans, perhaps, blessed with luck and skill or cursed with ill fortune and strange trials in their lives, but humans nonetheless.",
