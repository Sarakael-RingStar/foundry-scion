## Quality Assurance

- [ ] log on to the FVTT instance
- [ ] Validate using the `MODULE` compendium first!  If it isn't there check the journal entry/item if it is there ask the project manager to update the compendiums.  Otherwise note it as an issue.
- [ ] Compare the Chapter with the PDF, ensure all information is present
- [ ] Validate that all links go to the expected locations
- [ ] Check for any missing links, items that should be linked that are not
- [ ] If the section relates to an Actor, drag that actor to a scene, validate that they match the stat block, that their description is correct and correctly formatted ( `<div>` tags).  Ensure items on the actor are actual items from the module, or linked module
- [ ] If the section relates to an item, validate that item shares the same entity linked text, and that all links are valid as above
- [ ] Validate the layout is as close to the source material as possible.  Folder structure layout, tables, chapter names, ect
- [ ] If the section has a rollable table ( or card draw table). Verify that it has an appropriate Roll Table and that it functions as expected
- [ ] Any issues you find Log in the QA task and Create  Merge Request for repair.  Assign the MR to a maintainer for review
